### Course Management System Project Abstract:
In order to form a clear sketch of this project, here’s a brief introduction of the features and scope of  Course Management System. This project consists of three modules which are inter-linked to each other. These modules are:

Each of the above modules has certain specific task to perform. Administrator module is for controlling administrative works such as creating account for students and instructors, formation of curriculum and coding the subjects etc. So, Administrator Module can be considered as skeleton module on which other modules rely on. <br>

Student Module and Instructor Module have been designed for students and instructors to log in to the account created by administrator and share information. Students can register with application and submit their home work. Whereas, Instructors can check students’ home works and assign grades for their work.

### Features:

The following features of this project have made it more user friendly, efficient and secured.

* It enables the college or university to provide individual user account to each student.
* All the user accounts (instructors and students) are password protected. So, the database can be termed as secured.
* In Course Management System, only administrative section is allowed to create the account, but students and instructor can register with application.
After creating the account, the user can view his/her detail by using SQL query.
